# AI Automotive Fault Classifier 

This project aims to detect automotive system anomalies using machine learning techniques. It focuses on **ADAS-related faults** by analyzing sensor data and classifying whether the system is functioning normally or experiencing a fault.

## Objectives
- Learn and apply supervised ML algorithms.
- Understand how sensor data can indicate faults in automotive systems.
